# Strings to Morse Code Project

<h2>Description</h2>
This project serves as a simple yet functional tool, encoding text into morse code. I created a pre-defined mapping using a dictionary to match each character to its morse code equivalent. This program prompts the user to enter a series of text and it returns the corresponding morse code.
